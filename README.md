## Usage

The Clubsite depends on [WhyJustRun Core](https://github.com/WhyJustRun/Core), so first run it.

After Core is running, to start the Clubsite:

1) Use the default configuration: `cp .env.web{.sample,}`
2) Start the containers: `docker-compose up --build`

You should be up and running. Head to [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).
